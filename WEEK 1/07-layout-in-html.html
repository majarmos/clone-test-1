      Now that we have learned all of this amazing elements, how can we
      distribute them?
    </h1>

    <h2>
      Wait, before we learn how to do this guys, we need to learn a little bit
      of what html semantic & non-semantic elements are!
    </h2>

    <p>
      Semantic Elements = elements that their name provide context of their
      usage to both the programmer and the browser
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-Semantic Elements = elements whose names do not provide any context,
      and they can be used to mark up semantics or to basically group other
      elements together in your own.
    </p>

    <p>
      So far we have learned how to use html elements to place content within
      the browser, you see all of these elements are semantic in nature because
      their name describe their meaning
    </p>

    <p>This is an example of a paragraph</p>
    <h1>This is an example of a heading 1</h1>
    <a href="some-link">This is an example of a anchor Tag</a>

    <p>
      Although we can apply some semantics through applying an identifier or a
      class to any given element, we can use semantic elements to distribute
      content throghout our file according to what we are trying to achieve
      through our user.
    </p>
    <p>
      I.E: We need to provide a way for our users to
      <strong>navigate</strong> through our website, so we have to create a
      navigation section for our users. Luckily HTML, provides us with some
      elements that help us provide a good layout to our site.
    </p>

    <h2>Most Common Semantic Elements to provide layout:</h2>
    <h3>header</h3>
    <p>Specifies a header for a document or section</p>
    <header>Header Element</header>
    <hr />
    <h3>nav</h3>

      Defines navigation links like home, team, about-us, login, register
      etc....

    <h3>main</h3>
    <p>Specifies the main content of a document</p>
